The Indian Stock Forecast App is an application developed to predict the future stock price of NIFTY 50 companies, based on the Prophet time series model. An app that allows one to choose any stock out of the NIFTY 50 index, get a brief about the company, and generate a forecast of up to 4 years.

This project uses the following technologies:

-Streamlit to develop the interactive web application.
-Prophet for time series forecasting.
-yfinance, which retrieves historical stock data.

**User Definable Graphs**: The graphs on the app have a customized color scheme to improve the visibility of the data points â€“ mainly red, green, and yellow.

**User-Friendly Interface**: It is light grey in the background and a sidebar in cream colour, which makes it beautiful.
